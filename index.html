<h1>Brennan Colberg for Corvallis City Council</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I'm a software engineer, writer, small business owner, and (expecting) father,
	and have lived in Corvallis since 2019. I started attending and running my
	mouth at city council meetings about a year ago, and quickly learned that you
	can't get away with that for very long without being recruited to bear the
	torch of local governance yourself.
</p>
<p>
	Since I can remember, I've been fascinated with the smooth and efficient
	functioning of complex systems, with particular regard to business and
	technology. I hope to put that expertise to use on City Council by eliminating
	roadblocks to the enjoyability of constituents' lives and a strong local
	economy.
</p>

<h2>Endorsements</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		Laurie Chaplen, current incumbent of the seat I am running for (Ward 6)
	</li>
	<li style="opacity: 50%">
		you, maybe? email
		<a href="mailto:endorse@brennancolberg.com">endorse@brennancolberg.com</a>
		if so
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>
	I believe that most problems that Corvallisites care about can be solved
	simultaneously by
	<b>increasing housing production</b>
	(especially in the downtown and near-campus areas). This will (1) reduce the
	cost of living, (2) increase the quality of dwellings, (3) create well-paying
	jobs, (4) increase land values, (5) force fewer people into homelessness, (6)
	reduce traffic, and so forth. Ideally we do this without spending money,
	through regulatory + zoning reform and streamlining wherever possible.
</p>
<p>
	The rest of the problems we face can be solved in various ways by increased
	government spending (infrastructure upgrades, stronger public services, &c),
	which requires increasing government revenue, which we ideally do by
	<b>growing the economic pie</b>
	around here instead of whacking existing citizens harder like sad,
	overstressed piñatas. Most notably, Corvallis has a reputation for being
	actively hostile to new businesses. We should change this; as I understand it
	currently, the first task is to make it possible for people who
	<i>
		actively want to invest hundreds of millions of dollars of capital in our
		community specifically
	</i>
	to do so (instead of beating their interest to death like yet another flavor
	of piñata). Making it actively pleasant to invest money on our land and in our
	citizens is a stretch goal that can come later.
</p>

<h2>Governing Philosophy</h2>
<p>
	I am a firm believer in the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee_model_of_representation">
		trustee model
	</a>
	of representative democracy: if you elect me, I will govern according to my
	own judgement, and you should replace me if you don't like the result. Putting
	every random question to the citizens directly is bad for three reasons: (1)
	it's a waste of your time, (2) you'll make worse decisions than me because you
	know less about the subject (it's not your job!), and (3) the habit of doing
	this allows representatives to shirk the responsibility they
	<em>should</em>
	feel for the success (and—most importantly—failures!) of the government they
	lead.
</p>

<p>
	Politically, I identify as a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_liberalism">
		conservative liberal
	</a>
	, which displeases everyone a little bit. What this means in practice is that
	I view the market as the primary driver of human activity, and the proper role
	of the government as narrow: it should keep records (like birth and marriage
	certificates); play "referee" in the market (enforcing contracts and punishing
	things like false advertising); tax people lightly, fairly, and with healthy
	incentives; spend to solve collective action problems (such as building roads
	or operating a fire department); and do this all as efficiently as possible.
	Our liberal republic is a fantastic architecture; we should defend its
	structure against radical change, while being clear-eyed about its flaws so
	that we can dart in and fix imperfections as they arise.
