<p>Hi! I'm Brennan.</p>
<p>
	I'm a software engineer, writer, small business owner, and father, and have
	lived in Corvallis since 2019. I have spent thousands of hours building,
	studying, and trying to improve complex systems— a mental toolkit quite
	well-suited for government.
</p>
<p>
	Chasing an interest in land use and tax policy, I started participating in
	council meetings last year, and was recruited by
	<u>Laurie Chaplen (our current councilor here in Ward 6)</u>
	to run for her seat this November.
	<u>I have her sole endorsement.</u>
</p>
<p>
	<b>I hang out at Porter Park every Sunday from 2 PM until at least 3 PM.</b>
	Come say hi; I'd love to meet you and answer any/all questions you may have!
</p>

<h2>Major priorities</h2>
<p>
	Corvallis has many problems: we have the highest housing cost to income ratio
	in the state, and our city budget is struggling even as we skimp along doing
	the bare minimum. We need lower housing costs, higher incomes, and more city
	revenue.
</p>
<p>
	These problems are mostly economic, and they're all intertwined. This sounds
	bad
	<i>but is actually good,</i>
	because it means
	<u>we can fix them all in "one fell swoop,"</u>
	by making it easier for people to invest money in improving housing and
	businesses.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Streamlining housing regulations/permitting
		<ul>
			<li>
				→ more investment in housing
				<ul>
					<li class="b">→ more good jobs in the local area</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>↪ larger supply of housing</li>
			<li>
				↪ lower cost of housing
				<ul>
					<li class="b">→ higher-quality housing for everyone</li>
					<li class="b">→ more disposable income for everyone</li>
					<li class="b">→ more young people and families</li>
					<li class="b">→ less homelessness</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br />
	<li>
		Streamlining business regulations/permitting
		<ul>
			<li>
				→ more investment in local industry
				<ul>
					<li class="b">→ more good jobs in the local area</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>↪ larger local property tax base</li>
			<li>
				↪ more property tax revenue
				<ul>
					<li class="b">→ city not going bankrupt or into debt</li>
					<li class="b">→ more nice things paid for by the city</li>
					<li class="b">→ less increases in your water bill</li>
					<li class="b">→ less increases in your property taxes</li>
					<li class="b">→ more funding for the school district</li>
					<li class="b">↪ better education for our kids</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	People
	<i>want</i>
	to invest a lot in Corvallis, they just can't! To let them, we must make our
	<u>permitting and regulations faster and more predictable.</u>
	We don't need to lower our standards, we just need to make them easy to
	understand and quickly meet.
</p>

<h2>Minor priorities</h2>
<p>
	There are many nice things we can spend money on once (1) we have it and (2)
	the basics, like infrastructure and parks mainentance, are taken care of. I am
	partial to investment in "active transportation" (i.e. not passive (i.e. not
	cars)) infrastructure.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Building more & safer bike lanes</li>
	<li>Improving bus routes/frequencies</li>
	<li>
		Redesigning the
		<a href="https://www.fotw.info/flags/us-orcrv.html">Corvallis city flag</a>
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
	But these are
	<i>low priority.</i>
	Until everyone here can afford rent, and our local economy is not an embarassement,
	all else is a luxury and should not be focused on. (And once these
	problems are fixed, the nice things will be easy to pay for!)
</p>

<h2>Governing philosophy</h2>
<p>
	I am a
	<u>liberal.</u>
	I believe America's systems—including capitalism—are fundamentally sound, and
	primarily need
	<u>minor bugfixes</u>
	and
	<u>sane operation</u>
	to produce prosperity.
</p>
<p>
	I adhere to the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee_model_of_representation">
		trustee model
	</a>
	of representative government. If elected, I will consult public opinion as a
	datapoint when making decisions, but ultimately do what I think best, even if
	unpopular; and I will feel
	<u>personal responsibility</u>
	for Corvallis' wellbeing.
</p>
<p>
	I think politics should be a
	<u>calling, not a career.</u>
	I'm running because I love Corvallis and want to help fix its problems; not to
	seek fame, glory, wealth, or power. I
	<u>don't accept donations</u>
	from anyone, and will
	<u>donate my $4k stipend to a local nonprofit.</u>
</p>
